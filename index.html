<h2>Travis' Notes</h2>

<p><u><h3>Web Basics</h3></u>
The web consists of four major components:<br>
<b>- Computer/Browser:</b> What a user, like you, may use to surf the web<br>
<b>- Internet:</b> A complex network of connected computers <br>
<b>- Servers:</b> A set of computers that are optimized for file storage and recall <br>
<b>- HTTP:</b> A language format that is used to express data over the internet; essentially the language of the world wide web<br></p>

<p><u><h3>HTML</h3></u>
HTML stands for <em>Hypertest Markup Language</em> and is the primary document type that is used on the internet. 
HTML is made of up of text (which is the text you see),
markup (which is how that test looks on the screen), other documents (such as picture or video),
and links to other pages (like <a href="http://www.udacity.com">this example</a>).</p>

<p><u><h3>HTML Elements</h3></u>
HTML documents are comprised of HTML Elements, which utilize HTML tags to 
tell the computer what you wish it to do and how you wish text and documents 
to be displayed.  For instance, you can tell the computer to display the text as <b>bold</b>
or <em>italicized</em> just by providing the appropriate tags in the appropriate locations.  Tags can also be used to link other webpages 
or display videos or images (likely of cats).<br>

<p>These tags can be inline or block.  Inline tags will just display the contained contents inline with the surrounding text. 
However, a block element will create an invisible box around the content contained within that tag.</p>
